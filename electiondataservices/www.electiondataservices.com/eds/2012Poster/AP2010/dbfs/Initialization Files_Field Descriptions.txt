INITIALIZATION FILES
9/1/08

WHAT ARE INITIALIZATION FILES? 

Initialization files are made available prior to every election test, and before the general election. They are updated when when changes are made to the AP Elections System state databases. 

Use of the initialization files is not required, and your database or web pages may be built entirely "on-the-fly" from the data feeds provided at ftp://electionsonline.ap.org during the election. 

However, if you want to pre-initialize your database or web site with static information, you can download the initialization files from: ftp://electionsonline.ap.org/inits/<ST>/ e.g., ftp://electionsonline.ap.org/inits/VA/ 

(<SP> = State Postal Code, e.g., AK, CA, TX)

- The <SP>_ru.txt file contains a list of all "reporting units" (all counties (towns and cities for New England states), and the state) for that state. 
- The <SP>_pol.txt contains an entry for each candidate running in each AP-covered race for that state. 
- The <ST>_race.txt file contains a list of all active races (contested and uncontested) covered by the AP in an upcoming election for that state.
- The <ST>_rura.txt file lists all the reporting units that are participating in each race.
- The <ST>_fusion.txt file lists all active candidates running for the same race under two parties (currently CT, SC, NY, DE support fusion).
- The <ST_dist.txt lists, during Presidential Primaries, the Delegate Districts in an election where delegates are awarded by district. 

See below for specific field definitions for each initialization file.

Detailed information on the format of these files is provided as part of the AP Elections Online technical documentation, available at http://apdigitalsupport.ap.org.

ru_abbrv (NA) - string
	Short Name of reporting unit, usually same as ru_name for counties.

	Unique id within state for this race. A "race" describes the contest for a single 
	office.

of_number (NA) - integer 
	Unique id for this office within a state. An office is comprised of an 
	office type (e.g. "U.S. House") and a seat (e.g. District 1).

	zero ('0') for a statewide race.

race_id ("Race ID") - char
	Code indicating the type of race, generally "D" for Dem. primary, "R" 
	for Rep. primary, "G" for general election.

office_id ("Office ID") - char
	Code indicating the office type. Some codes are standard in all states, whereas 
	some are left up to the states to define on their own. 	National codes are: 
	P=President, S=Senate, H=U.S. House, G=Governor, I=Init./Prop. This describes 
	a category but not a unique id, i.e. all justices in a state may be code "J", 
	but that may cover State Supreme Court Justice all the way down to a town judge.

	Maximum number of winners in this race. Usually 1.

rt_number (NA) - integer
	Unique id in state to indicate the race type, similar to race id but more specific. 
	For example, both a Democratic Primary and a Special Democatic Primary have 
	the race race_id ("D") but they would have different rt_numbers.

	Name of party race applies to, e.g. "GOP" if a Republican Primary.

	"State Legislature" and seat number 47, may have the of_description "Santa Ana".

ot_number (NA) - integer
	Office type number, unique id within state for this office type, uniquely 
	describes a particular office type. For example, in the "Justice" example above,
	the office for Supreme Court Justice would be a different office type (ot_number)
	from Town Judge. However, all Town Judge offices would have the same ot_number.

	Office type name, one to one correspondence with the ot_number, 
	office type number id. For example: "Governor".

	A value of "1" indicates the race is a national race.
