        <p class="preeln-paradata">Joe Biden was born in Scranton, Pa. His family moved when he was 10 years old to Wilmington, Del., which became his home. He earned a bachelor's in history and political science at the University of Delaware in 1965 and a law degree at Syracuse University in 1968.</p>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">Biden practiced law in Delaware from 1968 to 1972 and was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970.</p>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972.</p>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">Biden entered the 1988 presidential race in June 1987, but withdrew three months later. He ran again in 2008 but dropped out after a poor showing in Iowa. In August 2008, he became the Democratic vice presidential candidate.</p>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">He was elected vice president that November with Barack Obama.</p>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">He is married to Jill Tracy Jacobs Biden and has three children. His first wife and a 13-month-old daughter were killed in an automobile accident in 1972 just weeks after he was elected to the Senate.</p>
      <h2 class="preeln-secthead">Profile</h2>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">Joe Biden, who spent six terms in the U.S. Senate, positioned himself over the years as a party elder and foreign policy expert, an image that helped earn him the nod as Barack Obama's 2008 running mate and a new job as vice president of the United States.</p>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">At age 29, Biden was one of the youngest politicians ever elected to the Senate, where he served 36 years and chaired the Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees. Biden voted against the Supreme Court nominations of John Roberts and Samuel Alito, and presided over the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominees Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. He was chief sponsor of a sweeping anti-crime bill that passed in 1994.</p>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden became one of the most influential foreign policy voices in Congress. An internationalist and strong supporter of the United Nations, he was a leading critic of what he saw as the arrogant, unilateralist approach to international affairs by President George W. Bush.</p>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">Biden voted in 2002 to authorize military intervention in Iraq but later became a vocal critic of the conflict. He also proposed a plan for peace in Iraq that would divide the country along ethnic lines. He opposed the 2007 troop surge credited with reducing the violence in Iraq.</p>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">In his short-lived 2008 presidential campaign, Biden took a populist approach aimed at ending the partisan divide and polarizing rhetoric separating Republican "red" and Democratic "blue" states. He loudly rejected the idea that Republicans are more patriotic and security-minded than Democrats, or that the GOP holds the moral high ground.</p>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">As vice president, Obama made Biden the administration's point person on Iraq. In December of 2011, Biden called and stressed an urgent need for Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to meet with leaders of other political blocs in Iraq to help resolve potentially explosive sectarian differences emerging in the wake of the U.S. troop withdrawal.</p>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">He's also the administration's frequent "ambassador" to white, working-class voters. In a June 2012 speech, he joked that the president had latched on to the theme in a way that "makes me sound like I climbed out of a coal mine in Scranton with a lunch bucket."</p>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">Biden, known for his signature rhetorical flourishes, has let his mouth occasionally get him into political trouble.</p>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">He received widespread criticism from remarks he made in August 2012 when he said Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans would put Americans "back in chains" in order to unshackle Wall Street.</p>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">In March 2010, he was caught on an open microphone proclaiming the signing of the Affordable Care Act into law was a big deal, with an expletive inserted for emphasis.</p>
        <p class="preeln-paradata">But Biden's gift of gab single-handedly pushed gay marriage to the forefront of the 2012 presidential campaign and inadvertently pressured Obama to declare his support for same-sex unions. Aides say Biden wasn't punished for remarks he made about equal rights for same-sex couples on a Sunday talk show in May 2012, but he did apologize to the president in private.</p>
